            <p>DC Comics, Inc. is an American comic book publisher and the flagship property of DC or "Detecive Comics" Entertainment. The company was founded in 1934 by founder Malcolm Wheeler-Nicholson. DC Comics dates back further than the release of the Marvel Universe and first gained its popularity during the time period of the years 1938 to the mid-1940s with the sale of their first comic books which were superhero comics with the genres of science fiction, drama/crime drama, and action. Superheroes of the franchise such as Batman, Superman, and Wonder Woman were the most popular superheroes in the first published comics, but in the mid to late 1940s, more superheroes were introduced into the DC Comics universe such as The Flash, Green Lantern, and Hawkman. As popularity grew, DC decided to expand their comics universe into the movie productions with partner company, Warner Bros.Inc. This is when the first live-action Batman TV series featuring superhero side-kick of Batman, Robin was released in 1966 on ABC. Now we have a variety of new comics, movies, TV shows, and video games based on DC Comics. Some releases include the Batman Beyond TV series, The Dark Knight trilogy, Superman trilogy, The Justice League movie series, The Arkham Knight game series, The Injustice game trilogy, The Flash, Wonder Woman, and the Aquaman movies. Also the famous comics including the first 1939 Batman DC Comic book, The Brave and The Bold, The Batman: Year one, and many more.
