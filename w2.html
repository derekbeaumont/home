<h2>The Creator/founder of DC Comics</h2>
  <p> The creator of DC Comics was American writer and entrepreneur Malcolm Wheeler-Nicholson (who has born Jan 7th 1890 and died in 1965). Wheeler-Nicholson founded the DC Comics company in 1937, accompanied by accountant Jack Liebowitz of Harry Donenfeld. They both published Jack's third magazine titled, 'Detective Comics' with the ensurement of Donenfeld's approval. Donenfeld decided he did not want to fund the magazine and unfairly pressured Wheeler-Nicholson to give ownership to him and his accountant. After Wheeler-Nicholson denied this request from Donenfeld, Donenfeld, out of pettiness, sued Wheeler-Nicholson of his Detective Comics company. This although, did not end the company's rein as Wheeler-Nicholson released his fourth magazine months after this downfall and with such resilience, he was able to continue the company's success  for what DC Comics is today.
